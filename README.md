# retrievelit: Research article corpus downloader

retrievelit consults metadata sources to find all articles in one year of a given journal or conference.  
It downloads metadata as JSON and BibTeX.  
It downloads PDFs.  
It uses a readable canonical naming rule for the PDFs (and corresponding BibTeX keys)
and avoids name collisions even across several related corpora.  

retrievelit is written in Python.

## How to install it

## How to use it
```bash
python main.py [-h] [--grouping {year,volume}] [--mapper MAPPER] [--metadata {dblp,crossref}] [--ieeecs] target [existing_folders ...]
```
Call it with `-h` yourself to see an up-to-date description of the options.

### Example
```bash
python main.py --grouping=volume --mapper=Springer EMSE-35 EMSE-34 EMSE-33
```
This will download the Volume 35 of `Empirical Software Engineering` and use class `SpringerMapper` to generate the PDF URLs.
The downloader will consider existing filenames in the folders `./EMSE-34` and `./EMSE-33` to avoid name conflicts. 
Downloads and additional files will be stored in a new folder `./EMSE-35`.

### Notes

#### Downloading ICSE Technical Track with dblp.org
- Due to limitations of the dblp publication API, downloading the Technical Track of ICSE is only possible when using the option `--grouping=volume` and supplying the publication year as the volume number.
- Example to download the technical track of ICSE 2021: `python main.py --grouping=volume --mapper=ComputerOrgConf --ieeecs ICSE-2021`
- All downloads of ICSE using `--grouping=year` will be mapped to `--grouping=volume` while keeping all other options the same.

#### Downloading Elsevier Publications
- When using the Mapper `ElsevierMapper` to download Journals published by Elsevier, such as IST (Information and Software Technology), the downloader will use the default webbrowser of the system to get the PDF.
- For this to work, it is assumed that your browser downloads are located in the `Downloads` folder inside your home directory. If this is not the case, change the variable `download_dir` in the class `PdfDownloader` to include the correct path to your downloads.
- Note that the downloader is unable to close the new browser windows after getting the PDFs, so you will have to close them manually after a successful run.
## How to extend it

### Adding a venue
#### Why
- Adding a new venue to the downloader is necessary if you want to download a venue which isn't currently included.
- You might also want to change existing metadata of a venue if you aren't happy with the metadata (e. g. venue name) in your metadata or bibtex file.
#### How
- All venues are placed in the `venues.py` file, located in the base directory.
- To add a new venue, add a new dictionary to the `VENUES` dictionary in the file. The key will be matched to the venue string you provide as an argument when starting the downloader.
- The dictionary must contain the following fields
  - `name`: The full name of the venue. (Used in the metadata and bibtex files)
  - `type`: The type of the venue such as conference or journal. (Used in the metadata and bibtex files)
  - `metadata_sources`: A dictionary containing additional data needed for each metadata source in the form of another dict. It's not required to fill this out for all sources, but selecting a source for which required data isn't provided will lead to failure of the program.
    - `dblp`: The dblp dict must contain the following fields. To get the values, open [dblp.org](https://dblp.org), search for the venue you want to add and use the URL. (e. g. `https://dblp.org/db/journals/ese/index.html`)
      - `type`: The type of the venue, usually the second to last part of the path. (here: `journals`)
      - `acronym`: The acronym of the venue, usually the last part of the path. (here: `ese`)
#### Example
```python
'EMSE': {
        'name': 'Empirical Software Engineering',
        'type': 'journal',
        'metadata_sources': {
            'dblp': {
                'type': 'journals',
                'acronym': 'ese'
            },
        },
    },
```

### Creating a new PDF URL mapper
A (doi-to-pdf-url) mapper is an object which implements the `get_pdf_url` method, which takes a (resolved) DOI and returns the URL of the matching PDF for the downloader.
#### Why
- Adding a new mapper is necessary when you added a new venue from a new publisher or with a different URL schema.
- You might also want to change existing mappers if their tests fail or you notice incorrect return values.
#### How
- All mappers are located in the `doi_pdf_mappers` folder in the base directory.
- For simplicity, create a new file for each mapper. The filename is irrelevant to the program, though it should be as clear as possible for other users.
- Create a new class with a name that reflects the publisher/site and the venue if necessary.
  It must end in `Mapper`, e. g. `SpringerMapper`.
- The class has to inherit from either of the following base classes. 
  Which one to use depends on whether your mapping function needs the "pure" DOI only or a "resolved" one.
  - `DoiMapper` (`doi_pdf_mappers.abstract_doi_mapper.DoiMapper`)  
    Use this base class if you only need the DOI to build the PDF URL.
  - `ResolvedDoiMapper` (`doi_pdf_mappers.abstract_resolved_doi_mapper.ResolvedDoiMapper`)  
    Use this base class if some kind of resolving the DOI is required to build the PDF URL.
- The class has to implement the method `get_pdf_url(self, doi)` which will receive the (resolved) DOI and must return a full URL containing the relevant PDF file.
- Use the logging module to log the final URL and any relevant steps before that at the `Debug` level.
- The program will automatically pick up the new class and match its name against the `--mapper` argument when starting the downloader.
- After verifying your mapper works as expected, please add a test for it by completing the following steps.
  - Go to the `test_mappers.py` file in the `tests` directory.
  - Import your new Mapper class.
  - Add a tuple containing the classname, as well as a string containing a (resolved) DOI which currently works with the mapper to the `inputs` list.
  - When running the test suite, this test will confirm whether the mapper still returns a working URL containing PDF data.
- Study `SpringerMapper` (in `doi_pdf_mappers/springer.py`) as a simple example.

### Adding a new metadata source
#### Why
#### How
#### Example

## TODO
- functionality:
  - Metadata file improvements
    - combine `state.json` and `metadata.json`
    - create set schema to validate file and aid in adding new metadata sources
    - include additional information (dts of retrieval, downloader configuration, etc.)
- usability improvements:
  - check arguments before using them
  - terminate with clear error messages (instead of crashing) upon unsuitable call arguments. 
  - I am no longer convinced that the title word in citation keys and PDF filenames is useful.
    (even once it works better and ignores stopwords)
    I suggest to leave it out by default and only add it if `--longname` is given.
  - use request sessions to reduce time for consecutive requests to the same server
- tech debt reductions:
- defects:
  - 2022-09-01: TSE-2021 crashed with "No such file or directory: 'TSE-2021/El-HieTÃ¼r21-$\\mathcal.pdf'"  
    Only few non-letter characters should be let through for the title word, mostly dashes.  
    For the basename, even dashes should be collapsed and 'El-Fakih' should become 'ElF', not 'El-'.
- documentation:
- quality assurance:
  - add test suite
  - GitHub Continuous Integration
  - perhaps add compatibility testing with tox (and tox-docker or so)  

and more.
