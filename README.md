# retrievelit: Research article corpus downloader

retrievelit consults metadata sources to find all articles in one year of a given journal or conference.  
It downloads metadata as JSON and BibTeX.  
It downloads PDFs.  
It uses a readable canonical naming rule for the PDFs (and corresponding BibTeX keys)
and avoids name collisions even across several related corpora.  

retrievelit is written in Python.
